1. Assume that you've have basic knowledge of Plover theory, including some "obscure" information.
    Read [Art of Chording](https://www.artofchording.com/) and [Learn Plover!](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/)
    if you don't.
2. Also read [Misleading Strokes in Plover's Dictionary][1] and [Brief Ideas][2].

3. For more brief ideas, see http://www.thesimplebrief.com/mark-kislingburys-theory-shortcuts-prefixes/. They're not
    in the default dictionary, however.
4. Usually, you must know how to pronounce a word correctly to write a word
    (for example, some "ch" is pronounced "k" such as the one in "archive" or "chaotic").
    If you're stuck, lookup the pronunciation before looking up the stroke. (if you're not a native English speaker)
5. Despite Plover being mostly phonetic, those rules usually work (there's no data to backup those statements):
    * The vowel typed is usually orthographic (take the first one vowel in the spelling, or first two if it's a diphthong)
        except when it's long and it's obviously pronounced differently.
        
        Example:

            * "ei" in "eight" or "ey" in "hey" is long A.
            * "ie" in "brief" is long E.
            * "ui" in "build" or "built" is **short** I.
            * "eye" is long I.
            * "ew" in "few" or "iew" in "view" is long U.
    * The vowel length is usually determined by:
        * For A, E and U, whether there's 1 or 2 vowels in the spelling.
        * For I, whether there's an -e or g. Example: sign, high, pie.  
            However it's possible for "i" to be long without -e or g, as in wild.
        * For O, it's only phonetic.
            Example: come/none/store use short O, home/fold/post/gold/host use
            long O.
            Sometimes words written with OW use long O (instead of the orthographic
            OU), such as "low" (but not "allow")
            Note that some of the words using long O can be typed with short
            O as well unless there are conflict.

6. For words that may be stroked with the vowel disambiguation stroke, they
    must be memorized.
    * ea/a-e: the AE stroke is used for other purpose (A-y) when there's
        no conflict. (Example: fear/father)
    * oa: (approach, coat, load) the OO stroke is used when there's a word
        with "oo". However in some cases there's no definition and the word
        with oa takes the long O stroke.
    * oo: Always stroked with the OO stroke.

7. By the way, "disambiguate" can only be typed with the DIZ stroke, not
    the DIS one. And "disambiguation" is not even in the default dictionary.
    Just type the above with "YON" appended instead.

8. 2-syllable words usually use long vowel when they're typed with one stroke.
    
    Example: better, recent, later
    Counterexample: letter, latter

9. Learn the prefixes and suffixes.
    * Prefixes: AU is usually used to substitute for the vowel.
    * Suffixes starting with "i" followed with a consonant: use Y-.
    * TODO.
    * Learn the rules yourself.

10. How to split the consonant
    * Stick as much as possible to the stressed consonant.
    * Repeat.
    * If there are only unstressed vowel left, done.
    
    Example:
    
    * desparate: `DESP` / (a: dropped) / `RAT` (the last A sound is short)

11. "al" is usually stroked (and pronounced) AU. "ol" is sometimes OE (folk)
12. "xt" in "next" or "text" or "jt" in "digit" is stroked -GT.

13. Weird consonant cluster can be typed like this (also briefly mentioned
    on "consonant cluster" lesson on "Learn Plover!")

    `mensch: MEN/*SH; sparkle: SPARK/-L; cusp: CUS/-P; tuple: TUUP/*L;`
    `struggle: STRUG/L; filch: FIL/*CH; dwarf: DWAR/-F`

    It's not clear when the star should be used. Also this doesn't include

14. -self is `*S`. There are some special cases, lookup them all.

15. In some briefs, L- is used for "al" (also, almost, although, already)
    and N- is used for "un" (under, until)

16. Special ways to add -ly: usual -> usually (change U to UU),
    actual -> actually (add -T), eventual -> eventually (add `*`)

17. Weird consonant cluster can be briefed (angle, single, struggle, dwarf)
